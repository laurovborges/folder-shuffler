# Description

This is a simple command line program that renames all the files in the directory it was opened from to a randomly generated string of letters and numbers.

# Usage

Simply open it from within the directory you want to shuffle and then confirm your decision. You can repeat the randomization as much as you'd like. Every name is guaranteed to be unique with no potential repeats.
